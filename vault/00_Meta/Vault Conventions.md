# Vault Conventions

Last reviewed: 2026-07-26

## Authority

Use this order when sources disagree:

1. live code, Git state, tests, and inspected data products;
2. `01_Project/Current State.md` and
   `05_Handoff/Handoff - Latest.md`;
3. decision and interface notes;
4. dated historical notes.

Use evidence labels where ambiguity matters:

- **Confirmed**: supported by live evidence or a direct user statement;
- **Hypothesis**: plausible but not adequately verified;
- **Superseded**: retained because it explains history but no longer current.

Always distinguish committed behavior from an uncommitted worktree.

## Note ownership

- `01_Project/Project Brief.md`: stable purpose, scope, interfaces, and code map.
- `01_Project/Current State.md`: currently verified technical snapshot.
- `02_Algorithm/`: durable reader and data-contract interpretation.
- `03_Decisions/Decision Log.md`: durable decisions and rationale.
- `04_Sessions/`: new dated historical evidence when a session merits it.
- `05_Handoff/Handoff - Latest.md`: concise next actionable state, risks, and
  verification entry points, plus a structured `Portfolio impact` section.

Link to the note that owns a detail rather than repeating the same narrative.

## Cross-session synchronization

Project agents update this vault automatically after durable milestones. They
do not edit the central second brain.

At each meaningful checkpoint, refresh the latest handoff with:

- `Central update needed: Yes` or `No`;
- portfolio-level changes, limited to status, priority, deadline, next
  decision, or research significance;
- a one-to-three-sentence sync summary.

The central agent uses that section to reconcile project work asynchronously.
Skip vault updates for transient exploration, unchanged state, and explicitly
read-only work.

## Legacy material

This vault predates the shared architecture. Its dated Markdown notes remain at
the vault root to preserve history. Treat them as session evidence. Do not
append later work to them or use their task lists as the current project plan.

Local Obsidian workspace state under `.obsidian/` is ignored. Project memory
remains version-controlled.
